Exagear Desktop is a piece of software that could be used to emulate x86 applications on ARM devices. It was discontinued a few years back, but it's still possible to use it.

Using ExaGear, I was able to run the full Spotify client, Zoom client, and more as well as others.

### Installation Steps
First install prerequisites with `apt`
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y bash coreutils findutils curl binfmt-support cron
```

Create a new directory (to download the packages and key)
```
mkdir ~/exagear
cd ~/exagear
```

Download and install required Exagear packages (follow the instructions for your bitness)
```
# 32-bit
wget https://archive.org/download/exagear-desktop_202111/exagear_3428-1_armhf.deb
wget https://archive.org/download/exagear-desktop_202111/exagear-dsound-server_010_armhf.deb
wget https://archive.org/download/exagear-desktop_202111/exagear-guest-debian-9_3428_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i exagear_3428-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i exagear-dsound-server_010_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i exagear-guest-debian-9_3428_all.deb

# 64-bit
wget https://archive.org/download/exagear-desktop_202111/exagear_3428-1_arm64.deb
wget https://archive.org/download/exagear-desktop_202111/exagear-dsound-server_010_arm64.deb
wget https://archive.org/download/exagear-desktop_202111/exagear-guest-debian-9_3428_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i exagear_3428-1_arm64.deb
sudo dpkg -i exagear-dsound-server_010_arm64.deb
sudo dpkg -i exagear-guest-debian-9_3428_all.deb
```

Patch exagear license
```
curl https://archive.org/download/exagear-desktop_202111/patch.sh | sudo bash
```

Now, run `sudo exagear`, and you're in an x86 environment! Make sure to run the following to update the subsystem:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

Take a look at the [internet archive](https://archive.org/download/exagear-desktop_202111) page for all the files.
