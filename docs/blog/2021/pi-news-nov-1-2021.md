- **Raspberry Pi Foundation announced their new SBC today:** the Raspberry Pi Zero W 2, the second iteration of the original Pi Zero W. It contains a massive jump in performance, including an upgraded CPU (1GHz Quad-core ARM Cortex-a53), which is a crazy improvement, as the original Pi Zero contained only one core! The GPU has been upgraded as well as the wireless and bluetooth onboard chip, and it's selling for only $5 more than its predecessor, at $15. Read more about this powerhouse [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/).

- **The Pi's Vulkan driver has been updated!** Version 1.1 conformance for Vulkan, the cross-platform graphics API written in C, has been approved by Khronos. This could improve graphics results up to 60%, according to [leepspvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbj7P3tVUHg). Stay tuned for more updates! (Original post by RPF, and can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/vulkan-update-version-1-1-conformance-for-raspberry-pi-4/))
