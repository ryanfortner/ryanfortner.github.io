Generating a SSH key for GitHub can sometimes be tricky, here's an easy method.

For this to work, you'll need an ssh installed on your system, and a Github account. ssh is preinstalled for most distributions, so you shouldn't have to worry about it.

### 1. Generate the key

Open a terminal prompt and execute the following command, making sure to substitute the email address with your email.

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

You will now be prompted to enter the file in which to save the key, it's safe to accept the default value here by clicking *enter*.

Then, enter a secure passphrase for the key if desired.

  <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"</code>

### 2. Adding the ssh key to the keyring

Now that you've generated the key, you need to tell ssh to use it when connecting to a remote server. You can do this by executing the following commands:

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### 3. Adding the ssh key to a GitHub account

Visit the following web page: [https://github.com/settings/ssh/new](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new), and paste the output of the following command in the key area.

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
