# About Me

Hello, I'm Ryan, I am a Linux programmer and open-sourcerer. I like to experiment with low-level programming as well as arm computing, expecially single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi and others. I also like to program in BASH and python.

My distro of choice is Debian, but I am a huge fan of Manjaro and Arch Linux even though I'm a beginner to them!

When not programming, I enjoy solving sudoku puzzles (btw check out this awesome [sudoku solver](https://github.com/RedHeadphone/sudoku-solver)!), and listening to lo-fi music. I also love the outdoors, one of my favorite things to do is watch the sun set :)

My distro of choice is Debian, but I am a huge fan of Manjaro and Arch Linux even though I'm a beginner to them!

Currently, I'm slowly learning C and BASH programming, and learning more about 3D printing and software packaging.
