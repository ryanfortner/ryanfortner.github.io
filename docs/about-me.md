# About Me

Hello, I'm Ryan, I am a Linux programmer and open-sourcerer. I like to experiment with several programming language, but I mostly use bash and c. I'm also interested in arm computing, expecially single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi and others.

My distribution of choice is Debian, but I am a huge fan of Manjaro and Arch Linux even though I'm a beginner to them!

When not programming, I enjoy solving sudoku puzzles and listening to lo-fi music. I also love the outdoors, one of my favorite things to do is watch the sun set :)

My distro of choice is Debian, but I am a huge fan of Manjaro and Arch Linux even though I'm a beginner to them!

Currently, I'm slowly learning C and BASH programming, and learning more about 3D printing and software packaging.
