# About Me

- I'm Ryan, a Linux programmer and open-sourcerer. I like to experiment with computers and test new things.

- Currently, I'm learning C and BASH programming, learning more about 3D printing, Debian software packaging, and the Linux operating system.

- I am a SBC nerd, and love to experiment with Raspberry Pies. I'm a maintainer of the [Pi-Apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps) project, a collection of shell scripts for installing arm-compatible software on your RPi (or other sbc).

- My Linux distro of choice is Debian, but I am also a fan of Armbian, Arch Linux, and derivatives, such as Manjaro. Ubuntu was one of my favourites, until Snap packages took over.

- When not programming, I enjoy solving sudoku puzzles and listening to instrumental music. I also love the outdoors, one of my favorite things to do is visit the mountains and watch the sun set :)
