# About Me

Hello, I'm Ryan, I am a Linux programmer and open-sourcerer. I like to experiment with several programming language, but I mostly use bash and c. I'm also interested in arm computing, especially single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi.

My distro of choice is Debian, but I am also a fan of Arch Linux and derivatives such as Manjaro.

When not programming, I enjoy solving sudoku puzzles and listening to lo-fi music. I also love the outdoors, one of my favorite things to do is watch the sun set :)

Currently, I'm slowly learning C and BASH programming, and learning more about 3D printing and Debian software packaging.
