# About Me

- I'm Ryan, a <b id="age"></b> year old Linux programmer and open-sourcerer. I like to experiment with several programming languages, but I mostly use bash and c.

- I am a SBC nerd, and love to experiment with Raspberry Pies. I'm a maintainer of the [Pi-Apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps) project, a collection of shell scripts for installing arm-compatible software on your RPi (or other sbc).

- My distro of choice is Debian, but I am also a fan of Arch Linux and derivatives such as Manjaro. Ubuntu was one of my favourites, until Snap packages took over.

- When not programming, I enjoy solving sudoku puzzles and listening to instrumental music. I also love the outdoors, one of my favorite things to do is visit the mountains and watch the sun set :)

- Currently, I'm learning C and BASH programming, and learning more about 3D printing, Debian software packaging, and the Linux operating system.
